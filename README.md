# VBA Green Stock Analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to use the original stock data we collected for 2017 and 2018 in the “All Stocks Analysis” VBA script and automate, or refactor the macro to pull the Ticker symbol, Total Daily Volume and Stock Return across all 12 tickers for each year at the click of a button.  The original All Stocks Analysis script was the foundation for the refactored code, the result was a faster output of our intended values.
### Results
The results from our initial code for years 2017 and 2018 yielded results in the following time frames:

The original code brought our results back for each stock year in about 2 seconds each time, the goal of the refactored code was to make this more efficient, lets see how the refactored code compared:

The results of the refactored code yield a dramatic increase in efficiency which is precisely what we were looking for. A cleaner, more concise code that runs more efficiency.
### Summary
Overall, the project yielded the results we were seeking; the code returned our values quicker than the original code. We were able to quickly analyze our returns and total volume for each stock, as well as visualize which stocks were returning positive returns year to year.
# Advantages or Disadvantage of refactoring code
The advantages are straight forward, we save time in our stock analysis which in turn allows us to act on our investments quicker. Time is money, and each second counts.  I was not able to identify any disadvantages of the refactored code.
# How pros and cons apply to refactoring the original script for all stocks
There are not any noticeable cons to refactoring the original code, this just is a common practice of adjusting your code to be more efficient and time saving. The pros of saving time on any analysis are the aggregate of time saved over all analyses, we save time which in turn saves money.
